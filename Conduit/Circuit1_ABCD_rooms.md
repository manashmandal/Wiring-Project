# Calculation of Length of the conduit:

## Length of the conduit used in A room:

* The Height of the Light Bracket from the floor level = 8 ft
* The Height of the Switch from the floor level        = 5 ft
* The Height of the Tube Light from the floor level    = 9 ft
* The Height of the ceiling fan from the floor level   = 10ft


Now,

*  The conduit run up to SB1 to 1A  = `0.91m`              
*  The conduit run up to 1A to 1C   = `0.89m`       
*  The conduit run up to 1C to 1B   = `1.11m`          
*  The conduit run up to 1C to 1D   = `1.11m`      
*  The conduit run up to SB1 to SB2 = `3.17m`          
*  The conduit run up to SB2 to 2C  = `1.09m`        
*  The conduit run up to SB2 to 2A  = `2.74m`         
*  The conduit run up to SB2 to 2B  = `2.33m`          
*  The conduit run up to SB2 to 2C  = `4.57m`        
*  The conduit run up to SB2 to 2D  = `3.91m`

**Length of the conduit of the room A** = `21.83m`

**Conduit length for `Circuit 1`** [For room `A, B, C & D`] = `21.83 * 4` = `87.32m`

#### Additional conduit:

* The conduit run up to FB1 to SB1 = 7.39m
* The conduit run up to FB1 to SB3 = 3.73m
* The conduit run up to FB1 to SB6 = 3.98m
* The conduit run up to FB1 to SB8 = 7.34m
* The conduit run up to SBP to P1  = 19.73m
* The conduit run up to SBP to P2  = 12.19m
* The conduit run up to P2 to P3   = 5.08m
* The conduit run up to SBP to P4  = 5.48m
