# Calculation of Length of the conduit:

## Length of the conduit used in A room:

The Height of the Light Bracket from the floor level = `8 ft`
The Height of the Switch from the floor level = `5 ft`
The Height of the Tube Light from the floor level = `9 ft`
The Height of the ceiling fan from the floor level = `10 ft`

Now,

  The conduit run up to `SB1` to `1A`	   = `0.91m`              
  The conduit run up to `1A` to `1C`     = `0.89m`       
  The conduit run up to `1C` to `1B`	   = `1.11m`          
  The conduit run up to `1C` to `1D`     = `1.11m`      
  The conduit run up to `SB1` to `SB2`   = `3.17m`          
  The conduit run up to `SB2` to `2C`    = `1.09m`        
  The conduit run up to `SB2` to `2A`    = `2.74m`          
  The conduit run up to `SB2` to `2B`    = `2.33m`          
  The conduit run up to `SB2` to `2C`    = `4.57m`        
  The conduit run up to `SB2` to `2D`	   = `3.91m`
  
**Length of the conduit of the room `A`** = `21.83m`
**Conduit length for `Circuit 1`** [For room `A, B, C & D`] = `21.83 * 4` = `87.32m`
