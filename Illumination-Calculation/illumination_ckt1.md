# Illumination, Rated Current & Wire calculation for `Circuit 1`:

In circuit 1, four rooms are included and they are same. These rooms are called `A, B, C, D`. When any room is measured then for this `Circuit 1` is four time of one room.

Calculation of Illumination:
----------------------------

### For Room A

Let, the illumination = `15` cd/ft<sup>2</sup>

**So, total illumination required:**

Area = 12.75 * 11.75 = 149.8 ft<sup>2</sup>

So, illumination= (149.8 * 15) / (0.5 * 0.8) = 5618 Lm

#### So, required light:

|       Name      | Rating | Illumination (Lm) | Quantity |
|:---------------:|:------:|:-----------------:|:--------:|
| Florescent tube |   36W  |        2450       |     1    |
| Florescent bulb |   20W  |        1090       |     3    |
