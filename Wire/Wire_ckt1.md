# Calculation of Live wire & Neutral wire:

For Room A:
-----------

Now,
```
	The wire run up to SB1 to 1A	= 0.91m              
	The wire run up to 1A to 1C     = 0.89m       
	The wire run up to 1C to 1B     = 1.11m          
	The wire run up to 1C to 1D     = 1.11m      
	The wire run up to SB1 to SB2   = 3.17m          
	The wire run up to SB2 to 2C    = 1.09m        
	The wire run up to SB2 to 2A    = 2.74m          
	The wire run up to SB2 to 2B    = 2.33m          
	The wire run up to SB2 to 2C    = 4.57m        
	The wire run up to SB2 to 2D	= 3.91m	
```
**Length of the wire of the room** `A` = `21.83m`
**Conduit length for circuit 1** [For Room `A, B, C & D`] = `21.83 * 4` = `87.32m`

### Additional Neutral wire:
```
	The wire run up to FB1 to SB1 = 7.39m
	The wire run up to FB1 to SB3 = 3.73m
	The wire run up to FB1 to SB6 = 3.98m
	The wire run up to FB1 to SB8 = 7.34m
	The wire run up to SBP to P1  = 19.73m
	The wire run up to SBP to P2  = 12.19m
	The wire run up to P2 to P3   = 5.08m
	The wire run up to SBP to P4  = 5.48m
```

**Total length of the Neutral wire of** `Circuit 1` = 152.24m
	
	Wastage = 15.22m

### Now, for `Circuit 1`
			
	Total Neutral Wire = 167.46m

> The live wire will be the double of the Neutral wire.
  
So Live wire = `167.46 * 2` = `334.92m`

**So, Total 1.5 mm<sup>2</sup> (1/1.4) wire is required for `Circuit 1`** = `167.46 + 334.92` = `502.38m`
