# Calculation of Live wire & Neutral wire:

## For Room E

Length of the wire used in E room:

Now, 
```
  The wire run up to FB2 to SB11 = 5.25m
  The wire run up to SB11 to 11A = 1.19m
  The wire run up to 11A to 11C = 1.90m
  The wire run up to 11C to 11D  = 1.60m
  The wire run up to 11C to 11B = 1.60m
  The wire run up to SB11 to SB12 = 3.20m
  The wire run up to SB12 to 12B = 2.33m
  The wire run up to 12B to 12F = 2.28m
  The wire run up to SB12 to 12A = 1.01m
  The wire run up to 12A to 12C = 1.01m
  The wire run up to 12C to 12D  = 1.34m
  The wire run up to 12D to 12B = 1.98m
  The wire run up to P4 to P5 = 6.18m
```
Total length of the Neutral wire of Room E = 30.87m
				Wastage = 3m 
Total Neutral wire of Room E = 33.87m

The live wire will be the double of the Neutral Wire. So Live wire = 33.87 * 2 = 67.74m


Length of the wire used in F room:

Now,
The wire run up to FB2 to SB13 = 6.78m
The wire run up to SB13 to 13A = 0.91m
The wire run up to 13A to 13B = 2.19m
The wire run up to 13B to 13C = 2.23m
The wire run up to SB13 to SB14 = 3m
The wire run up to 13B to 13D = 0.78m
The wire run up to SB14 to 14A = 2.76m
The wire run up to 14A to 14C = 2.71m
The wire run up to SB14 to 14D = 5.05m
The wire run up to FB2 to P6 = 8.45m

Total Neutral wire of Room E = 34.86m

			Wastage = 3m


Total Neutral wire of Room E = 37.86m

The live wire will be the double of the Neutral Wire. So Live wire = 37.86 * 2 = 75.72m


Length of total Neutral Wire used in Veranda:

The wire run up to FB1 to SB5 = 4.24m
The wire run up to SB5 to 5C = 3.73m
The wire run up to 5C to 5B = 1.9m
The wire run up to 5B to 5A = 3.65m
The wire run up to FB2 to SB10 = 6.32m
The wire run up to SB10 to 10B = 0.3m
The wire run up to 10B to 10A = 3.69m
The wire run up to 10B to 10C = 4.59m

Total Neutral wire in Veranda = 28.42m
			Wastage  =  3m

Live wire in Veranda = 31.42 * 2 = 62.84m

So, Total 1.5 mm2 (1/1.4) wire in Circuit 2 = (62.84 + 28.42 + 75.72 + 37.86 + 33.87 + 67.74)m
			    = 306.45m
